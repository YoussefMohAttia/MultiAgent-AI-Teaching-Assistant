    "often justify weapons development under national security imperatives. However, even military \n",
    "engineers are bound to avoid deceptive or malicious acts and to refuse assignments that endanger public \n",
    "life without proper safeguards. For example, if an engineer learns that a drone design is likely to fail \n",
    "dangerously or breach the laws of armed conflict, the NSPE code would require them to raise concerns \n",
    "or withdraw from the project . Ethical guidelines from IEEE and IET similarly emphasize human \n",
    "oversight: weapons should not operate with full autonomy to kill without human judgment.  \n",
    "In practice, some argue engineers cannot be held personally liable if a lawful weapon is misused. \n",
    "Nevertheless, ethical training encourages engineers to consider the downstream consequences of their \n",
    "designs. If a drone’s sensors are insufficient to distinguish combatants from civilians, engineers must \n",
    "recognize the risk of collateral damage. Engineering societies increasingly call for “caution” in weapon \n",
    "automation – noting that “drones pose serious ethical dilemmas around how, and whether, to \n",
    "regulate” their use . By applying professional codes, engineers must ensure their systems include fail\n",
    "safe and respect targeting protocols (e.g., the Geneva Conventions’ principle of distinction), even when \n",
    "operating in war. This means rigorous testing, honest reporting, and possibly whistleblowing if safety \n",
    "is compromised. \n",
    "Civilian Impact and Broader Consequences \n",
    "The deployment of drones in Ukraine has had severe humanitarian consequences. Though proponents \n",
    "claim precision, in practice both Russian and Ukrainian drone strikes have hit civilian areas. For \n",
    "instance, in January 2025 the UN reported short-range drones killed more Ukrainians than any other \n",
    "weapon: 27% of civilians killed (38 out of 139) and 30% of injuries (223 out of 738) in that month were \n",
    "from drone strikes as shown in fig(3). These “FPV” drone bombs, launched by operators on the ground, \n",
    "frequently struck cars, streets, and other public places. The Head of the UN Human Rights Mission in \n",
    "Ukraine noted, “Short-range drones now pose one of the deadliest threats to civilians in frontline areas.”. \n",

    "Likewise, a UN report documented a single Russian drone strike on 17 May 2025 that killed 9 evacuees \n",
    "in a civilian minibus  \n",
    "Figure 3 \n",
    "Persistent drone barrages also inflict psychological trauma. Civilians describe almost nightly air-raid \n",
    "sirens as “bombing of sleep” – people cannot rest, leading to widespread insomnia and PTSD risks . \n",
    "Mental health professionals in Ukraine warn that sleep deprivation from constant drone attacks \n",

    "publicly called the April 2025 Marhanets bus hit (9 killed) “a deliberate war crime” . These episodes \n",

    "external actors promoting drone technology. Moreover, the success of drones in Ukraine has spurred a \n",
    "global arms race: dozens of countries are now rapidly expanding their drone fleets. Ethically, this raises \n",
    "the prospect of future conflicts being fought by increasingly automated means – a trend that demands \n",
    "robust oversight. Analysts warn that without new norms, the convenience of drone strikes could lower \n",
    "the bar for entering conflicts . Indeed, one dilemma is whether removing pilot risk makes leaders more \n",
    "prone to launch attacks. If the human cost to one’s own forces is negligible, will governments bypass \n",
    "diplomacy more readily? Engineering ethicists worry that “the perceived safety for operators lowers the \n",
    "threshold for war,” potentially leading to more frequent or prolonged conflicts . \n",
    "The combination of low cost and high lethality of drone swarms is creating a new paradigm. Combatants \n",

    "restrictions be placed on fully autonomous swarms? Should there be an international treaty limiting \n",
    "kamikaze drones? Engineers, who often champion innovation, must also engage in public and policy \n",
    "dialogues to help shape such regulations in line with humanitarian principles. In the meantime, they \n",
    "must embed ethical safeguards in design (e.g., programming strict no-fire zones, implementing human\n",

      "REFERENCE SUMMARY:\n",
      "\n",
      "The lecture on drone warfare, particularly in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, delves into the ethical and technical complexities associated with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in modern combat. It highlights how drones have transformed warfare, enabling surveillance and precision strikes that were traditionally conducted by manned aircraft. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine serves as a case study to explore the implications of drone warfare, where both sides have deployed thousands of small drones for intelligence, reconnaissance, and direct attacks. This shift raises significant ethical dilemmas for engineers who design these systems, particularly regarding the balance between mission autonomy and accountability, as well as cost-efficiency versus the risk of indiscriminate use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lecture outlines several objectives, including an examination of the technical and ethical trade-offs in modern combat drones, a comparison of different drone models, an analysis of documented drone strikes in Ukraine and their humanitarian effects, and a reflection on the broader responsibilities of engineers in armed conflict. The discussion emphasizes the dual nature of drones as instruments of both progress and destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key focus is the design trade-offs between different drone models, exemplified by the Iranian-made Shahed-136 and the Turkish Bayraktar TB2. The Shahed-136 is characterized as a low-cost, single-use kamikaze drone with limited guidance capabilities, allowing for mass deployment but sacrificing accuracy. In contrast, the Bayraktar TB2 is a more sophisticated, reusable UAV with advanced avionics and precision strike capabilities, albeit at a significantly higher cost. This comparison illustrates the ethical tensions engineers face when balancing cost, precision, autonomy, and control in drone design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lecture further discusses the varying levels of autonomy in modern drones, raising questions about accountability in the event of misidentification of civilian targets. The integration of artificial intelligence in drones complicates these ethical considerations, as current engineering codes emphasize transparency and verification, which autonomous systems can obscure. Engineers are thus confronted with the challenge of innovating military technology while ensuring compliance with ethical standards and international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers involved in military projects must navigate their professional ethical obligations, particularly the NSPE Code of Ethics, which mandates prioritizing public safety, health, and welfare. The lecture highlights the necessity for engineers to avoid deceptive practices and to raise concerns if their designs pose risks to public safety. Ethical training encourages engineers to consider the potential consequences of their designs, particularly in terms of collateral damage and the implications of automation in warfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humanitarian impact of drone warfare in Ukraine is profound, with reports indicating that drone strikes have resulted in significant civilian casualties. The UN has documented instances where drones have killed and injured civilians, emphasizing the urgent need for engineers to consider foreseeable harm under just-war norms. The psychological effects of persistent drone attacks, including insomnia and PTSD, further complicate the ethical landscape, as the societal implications of drone warfare extend beyond immediate physical destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lecture concludes by underscoring the ethical responsibilities of engineers in the context of drone warfare. It asserts that design decisions carry moral weight and that engineers must embed safeguards, maintain human oversight, and adhere to professional codes that prioritize public welfare. The findings suggest that while cost-effective drones like the Shahed enable mass attacks, they often violate principles of distinction, leading to high civilian casualties. Conversely, precision drones like the Bayraktar TB2, while more discriminating, are costly and vulnerable, limiting their deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the lecture calls for a proactive engagement from the engineering community in ethical reflection and policymaking to ensure that drone technology aligns with humanitarian principles. As the landscape of warfare continues to evolve with the proliferation of autonomous weapons, the commitment to ethical standards will be crucial in shaping the future of combat and safeguarding human values.\n",

    "#STUDENT_SUMMARY = \"\"\"This paper talks about drones and how they are used in the Russia-Ukraine war, but mostly it says drones are important because they are modern technology. It mentions some drones like Iranian and Turkish ones, but does not really explain them clearly. The paper also talks about ethics, but only in a general way, saying engineers should be careful without giving strong reasons. Sometimes it discusses civilians and damage, but the examples are mixed up and not very clear. Overall, the paper seems to argue that drones are bad and also useful at the same time, but it does not clearly prove either point. The conclusion repeats earlier ideas and says engineers have responsibilities, which is already obvious.\"\"\"\n",
    "STUDENT_SUMMARY = \"\"\"Scope & purpose: The paper examines the ethical, technical, and humanitarian dimensions of drone warfare as revealed by the Russia–Ukraine conflict. It compares two representative platforms (a low-cost loitering munition and a higher-end reusable tactical UAV), explains how engineering choices influence both military effectiveness and civilian risk, documents concrete humanitarian impacts observed in Ukrainian cities, and draws implications for engineers, professional codes, and policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical comparison (design trade-offs):\n",
    "\n",
    "The report contrasts cheap kamikaze loitering munitions (exemplified by the Shahed-136 class) with larger, reusable tactical drones (exemplified by the Bayraktar TB2 class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheap loitering munitions prioritize low unit cost and mass producibility, enabling salvo/swarm attacks that saturate defenses but sacrifice precision, reusability, and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusable tactical drones prioritize endurance, sensors, and precision weapons; they enable targeted strikes and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) but are costlier and fewer in number and vulnerable to air defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key engineering trade-offs: cost vs. precision, autonomy vs. human control, and reliability vs. operational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomy, control, and accountability:\n",
    "\n",
    "The report highlights varying autonomy levels: preprogrammed loiter-and-strike behavior versus real-time human-in-the-loop control via datalink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased autonomy (e.g., automated target recognition) raises responsibility and verification challenges: who is accountable when an algorithm misidentifies a target?\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors stress transparency, verification, and human oversight as necessary to preserve traceable decision chains and comply with laws of armed conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineers’ ethical responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional codes (the report cites the NSPE Code as an example) obligate engineers to prioritize public safety, honesty in reporting, and to raise concerns or withdraw from work that foreseeably endangers civilians.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper argues engineers should bake in safeguards (fail-safes, no-fire geofencing, robust verification) and resist design choices that make misuse or indiscriminate harm likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical practice includes anticipating downstream misuse and participating in policy/dialogue to shape norms and regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humanitarian and societal impacts (case evidence):\n",
    "\n",
    "The report compiles documented incidents and monitoring statistics showing short-range drones became a leading cause of civilian casualties in some months, and that loitering munitions often cause indiscriminate harm when guidance or targeting is poor. The UN monitoring findings and several Reuters-reported strikes are used as examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case studies discussed include large combined missile-and-drone strikes on Kyiv and multiple strikes on passenger buses in Kherson and Marhanets that resulted in civilian deaths and injuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond direct casualties and infrastructure damage (schools, power plants, apartments), persistent night-time drone barrages inflict widespread psychological harm — sleep deprivation, increased PTSD risk, and community-level erosion of trust in institutions and technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broader implications for warfare & policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheap, effective strike drones lower the operational and political costs of kinetic action, potentially lowering the threshold for using force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proliferation risk: success in one conflict accelerates global acquisition and doctrinal adoption, increasing the chance of drone-driven escalation elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper advocates for stronger international norms or treaties to limit fully autonomous lethal swarms and stricter controls on kamikaze loitering munitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions & recommendations (practical takeaways):\n",
    "\n",
    "Design safeguards: engineers should implement human-in-the-loop controls, robust identification/verification systems, geofencing/no-fire zones, and clear fail-safe behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical practice: engineers must apply professional codes (prioritizing public welfare), perform rigorous testing, and report safety shortfalls honestly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy engagement: technical experts should contribute to regulation, standard setting, and public debate to ensure weapons development aligns with humanitarian law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring & accountability: increased transparency and audit logs for targeting decisions are recommended so misuse can be investigated and responsibility assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigation & humanitarian response: strengthen civil defense, early-warning, and mental-health support in affected areas while pursuing diplomatic and legal avenues to curb indiscriminate use.\n",
