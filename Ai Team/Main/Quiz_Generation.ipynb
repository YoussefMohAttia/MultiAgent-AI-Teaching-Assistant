It analyzes how engineering choices in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) like the low-cost Iranian Shahed-136 loitering munition and the sophisticated Turkish Bayraktar TB2 reflect trade-offs in cost, autonomy, and reliability, and how these design choices pose moral challenges. The study reviews how engineers’ responsibilities (per codes like NSPE) intersect with the deployment of lethal autonomous weapons. It also assesses the civilian impact of nightly drone barrages – from infrastructure damage to psychological trauma – using case examples (e.g., Kyiv and Kherson strikes). Key findings highlight that cheap, kamikaze drones enable mass attacks that often violate the just-war principles of distinction and proportionality, causing widespread fear and sleep deprivation among civilians. The paper concludes that engineers must carefully weigh the public welfare in designing military systems, and that unchecked drone proliferation risks eroding public trust in technology and international law.\n",
        "\n",
        "Introduction:\n",
        "Drone warfare has become a defining aspect of modern combat, raising profound ethical questions in engineering. Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) now conduct surveillance and precision strikes that were once the sole domain of manned aircraft. Their availability and effectiveness have significantly altered conflict: analysts note that both sides in Ukraine have deployed thousands of small drones for intelligence, reconnaissance, and direct attack. The war in Ukraine thus exemplifies the new era of drone warfare and its ethical implications. Engineers designing these systems face dilemmas such as balancing mission autonomy against accountability, and optimizing cost-efficiency at the risk of indiscriminate use.\n",
        "\n",
        "The importance of this topic to engineering ethics lies in the tension between professional duties and wartime imperatives. Codes of ethics (e.g., the NSPE Code) insist engineers \"hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public,\" yet military drones are explicitly built to kill. This study explores how engineering decisions in drone design and deployment create moral hazards, and examines specific case studies from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objectives are to:\n",
        "• outline the technical and ethical trade-offs in modern combat drones\n",
        "• compare different drone models in terms of design and use\n",
        "• analyze documented drone strikes in Ukraine and their humanitarian effects\n",
        "• reflect on the broader responsibilities of engineers in armed conflict.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technical and Ethical Dimensions of Drone Warfare:\n",
        "Design Trade-offs: Shahed-136 vs. Bayraktar TB2\n",
        "Combat drones vary widely in complexity, cost, and capability. A clear illustration is the difference between the Iranian-made Shahed-136 and the Turkish Bayraktar TB2. The Shahed-136 is a kamikaze \"loitering munition\" – a single-use drone carrying a warhead for one-way missions. It is small (length ≈3.5 m, wingspan ≈2.5 m, weight ~200 kg) with a crude autopilot (inertial/GPS guidance) and a ~50 kg explosive payload. In contrast, the Bayraktar TB2 is a much larger reusable UAV (length 6.5 m, span 12 m, MTOW 700 kg) with sophisticated avionics. It carries four smart guided bombs or missiles (total 150 kg payload) and can fly for 27 hours with live human control at up to 222 km/h.\n",

        "\n",
        "These design choices reflect different priorities. The Shahed is extremely cheap (reported production cost tens of thousands of USD), allowing Russia to launch salvos of dozens each night. This swarming strategy saturates air defenses but sacrifices accuracy and reusability. By contrast, a Bayraktar costs on the order of $1–5 million, is human-piloted, and must return after each mission. Its advanced sensors and precision weapons enable targeted strikes with minimal collateral damage when used properly, but its high cost and vulnerability to air defenses limit the number that can be deployed. Engineers must trade cost vs. precision and autonomy vs. control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Control and Autonomy\n",
        "Modern drones incorporate various levels of autonomy. A key question is how much decision-making the drone can do independently. The Shahed-136 uses a pre-programmed flight plan to loiter and descend on a target, with only a basic inertial/GPS guidance loop. The TB2, by contrast, is controlled in real-time by a pilot via encrypted datalink, allowing human judgment in target selection. The increasing integration of AI (e.g., for obstacle avoidance or automated target recognition) raises new ethical concerns: Who is responsible if an autonomous system misidentifies a civilian structure as a military target? The issue of accountability looms large – current engineering codes expect transparency and verification, but autonomous drones can obscure decision chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "Engineers’ Responsibilities and Codes of Ethics\n",
        "Engineers involved in military projects must reconcile their work with professional ethical standards. The NSPE Code of Ethics explicitly states that \"Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.\" Designing lethal systems seems at odds with this canon, but engineers often justify weapons development under national security imperatives. However, even military engineers are bound to avoid deceptive acts and to refuse assignments that endanger public life without proper safeguards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Civilian Impact and Broader Consequences\n",
        "The deployment of drones in Ukraine has had severe humanitarian consequences. Though proponents claim precision, in practice both Russian and Ukrainian drone strikes have hit civilian areas. In January 2025 the UN reported short-range drones killed more Ukrainians than any other weapon: 27% of civilians killed (38 out of 139) and 30% of injuries (223 out of 738) that month were from drone strikes. Persistent drone barrages also inflict psychological trauma. Civilians describe almost nightly air-raid sirens as \"bombing of sleep\" – people cannot rest, leading to widespread insomnia and PTSD risks. Infrastructure damage is another ethical concern, with drones striking schools, power plants, and apartment blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ethical Implications for Society and Future Warfare\n",
        "Widespread drones affect public trust in technology and warfare. When people see autonomous or remotely piloted weapons causing civilian suffering, they may lose faith in institutions and engineers who develop such systems. Moreover, the success of drones in Ukraine has spurred a global arms race. Analysts warn that without new norms, the convenience of drone strikes could lower the bar for entering conflicts. Engineering ethicists worry that \"the perceived safety for operators lowers the threshold for war,\" potentially leading to more frequent or prolonged conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Case Study Snapshots\n",
        "• Kyiv and major cities: On 24 April 2025, Russia launched a combined missile-and-drone assault on Kyiv, killing at least 12 people and wounding about 90.\n",
        "• Public transport: Drones have repeatedly targeted buses, including strikes in Kherson and Marhanets that killed civilian passengers.\n",
        "• Battlefield surveillance: Ukrainian forces have used Bayraktar TB2 drones to scout and strike isolated armored vehicles, raising questions about reconnaissance vs. attack uses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "Drone warfare in Ukraine exemplifies the complex ethical challenges of engineering modern weapons. The Shahed-136 and Bayraktar TB2 represent two ends of the spectrum: one a cheap mass-produced \"suicide\" UAV, the other an expensive precision drone. To prevent civilian suffering, engineers must embed safeguards, maintain human oversight, and heed professional codes requiring public safety to be paramount.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key findings include:\n",
        "1. Cost-effective drones like the Shahed enable mass attacks that overwhelm defenses but often violate the principles of distinction.\n",
        "2. Precision drones like the TB2 can be more discriminating but are costly and vulnerable, potentially limiting their deployment.\n",
        "3. Psychological harm from nightly drone barrages imposes long-term burdens on society.\n",
        "4. Engineering ethics require balancing military objectives with minimization of harm; according to NSPE, engineers must prioritize public welfare.\n",
